        <p class="leading-normal text-lg text-stone-800 mb-6 dark:text-slate-50">Edward ‘Ed’ Gorynski died at the age of 78, on June 22, 2023, at his home in Lincoln, Nebraska. Ed is
        survived by his wife, Grace Gorynski, children, Michelle Briscoe (deceased) (Gary), Scott Gorynski (Candice),
        Allison Gerkensmeyer (Brian), Deidre Cartwright (Tom), Kyle Gorynski, Alec Gorynski (Laura),
        his grandchildren, dog Ginger, and sisters, Helen Cavin (Don), Chris Ruzicka, and Mary Gorynska-
        Lehmann.</p>

        <p class="leading-normal text-lg text-stone-800 mb-6 dark:text-slate-50">Ed, and twin sister Helen, were born in Germany on September 25, 1944, to his Polish parents
        Eugene &amp; Ksenia Gorynski, who were imprisoned in a Nazi Forced Labor Camp. The family struggled
        to survive under Nazi rule, often risking their lives to steal potatoes from the fields they were forced
        to plough. They continued to live in the camp after it was liberated by Allied Forces in 1945, until
        they immigrated to the US as refugees in 1949. They built a small but strong community with other
        refugees, where Ed became know as ‘Little Churchill’, for his blond hair, wide face, and little pot
        belly. One of his sister’s favourite stories from the camp is how little Ed liked so much the clay he
        was playing with at the camp school, that he decided to sneak it home by sticking it in his ears and
        pulling his hat down to cover it.</p>

        <p class="leading-normal text-lg text-stone-800 mb-6 dark:text-slate-50">When the Gorynskis left the camp, their journey to the US was sponsored by a Nebraska City family,
        whom they repaid by living and working on their farm for several years. His family then moved to
        Lincoln, Nebraska, where they lived and worked at St Thomas Orphanage until they saved enough
        money to buy their first home in 1963. Ed was proud of his Polish heritage, and his family’s strength
        to overcome war, loss, and hardship, to build a better life in America for their children and
        grandchildren.</p>

        <p class="leading-normal text-lg text-stone-800 mb-6 dark:text-slate-50">After Ed graduated from Pius X Highschool in 1963, he served six years in the Army National Guard
        as a part of the Vietnam War efforts. In 1971 Ed began working for Burlington Northern (Santa Fe)
        Railroad, first as a section hand, laying and maintaining the railroad tracks, then as a switchman,
        before he became a crew caller, and a crew call office manager until his retirement. Then he and
        Grace, moved to Colorado for six years before returning to Lincoln.</p>

        <p class="leading-normal text-lg text-stone-800 mb-6 dark:text-slate-50">Ed and Grace married on March 2, 1975, in Calico Rock, Arkansas, on a cliff overlooking the Ozark
        Mountains and the White River. Grace and Ed had a happy, supportive, and laugh-filled marriage for
        48 years. They raised six children and enjoyed their many grandchildren, who knew him as their
        ‘Poppy’. Ed is remembered by his family and friends as warm, loving, smart and funny. He was
        always ready with a smile and a joke, and no matter how many times Grace heard the same joke,
        she laughed like it was the first time.</p>
        
        <p class="leading-normal text-lg text-stone-800 mb-6 dark:text-slate-50">Ed shared his love of the outdoors with his children, taking them on many camping and fishing trips,
        and listening to Dire Straits, Alabama, or the Everly Brothers on the way. If we were unlucky, we’d be
        subjected to his turkey calling tapes to practice for his next hunting trip with friends Walter and
        Willy. Ed was also a talented gardener who grew many vegetables but was most famous for his
        delicious tomatoes. Every year he’d challenge his kids to a contest of who could guess the first ripe
        tomato of the season. On a summer evening, you’d often find him watching baseball while chewing
        on a toothpick or munching on sunflower seeds. He had a soft spot for the Kansas City Royals (only
        when they were winning), but was unwaveringly loyal to his Nebraska Huskers, making sure to watch
        every game. Ed and Grace also loved to travel, including many trips to England to visit their daughter
        and their favorite place, Lynton and Lynmouth, Devon.</p>

        <p class="leading-normal text-lg text-stone-800 mb-6 dark:text-slate-50">Ed was a dedicated member of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), who supported Ed to stay sober for over
        45 years. He attended meetings almost every week and sponsored countless individuals to overcome their alcohol misuse. After he retired, he volunteered in a local prison, leading AA groups
        and sponsoring individuals. Ed had a profound ability to project warmth, empathy, kindness, and
        non-judgement, and to make every person feel seen and understood.
